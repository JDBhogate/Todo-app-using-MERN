# To-Do List Web Application 
---
This is a to-do list app made with the MERN(Mongo Express React Node) Stack.
I did this app to learn how to combine all the individual technologies I learned and create an app in the MERN stack.

## Steps to run this web application:
1. You can fork it into your machine or just download the zip.
2. Download the Mongodb Compas desktop application or you can use Mongodb web application.
3. You have to open __Todo-app-using-MERN__ folder in your vscode.
4. Open >Todo-app-using-MERN >Server >index.js and do the MongoDB connection by changing mongoose.connect to your localhost available in your home page of MongoDB application.
5. Then open terminal and do the next commands
cd todolist
npm run dev
```
